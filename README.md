# Music Genre Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the genre of music using machine learning techniques, with a primary emphasis on leveraging the Scikit-Learn library. We have implemented and optimized multiple models, including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree, and random forest, to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of music genre classification.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Dataset Analysis:
- We have thoroughly examined and comprehended the structure and content of the music dataset.
- Identified the pertinent features and the target variable for genre classification.

### 2. Data Preprocessing:
- Employed essential preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the music dataset for model training.
- Handled missing data, standardized features, and resolved any inconsistencies.

### 3. Feature Engineering:
- Extracted meaningful features from the music data, transforming them into a format suitable for machine learning.
- Utilized techniques like feature scaling and one-hot encoding to prepare the data for modeling.

### 4. Machine Learning Models:
- Implemented various machine learning models, including:
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Utilized the KNN algorithm to classify music genres based on feature similarity.
  - **Decision Tree:** Built decision tree models to make genre predictions by splitting the data into nodes.
  - **Random Forest:** Employed ensemble learning with random forest models to improve classification accuracy.

### 5. Model Optimization:
- Fine-tuned model hyperparameters to enhance predictive performance.
- Employed techniques like cross-validation and grid search to find the optimal model settings.

### 6. Evaluation and Metrics:
- Evaluated the models' performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the results to assess the effectiveness of genre classification.
